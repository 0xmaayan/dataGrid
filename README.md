A small app for importing data from .csv file and display it in 3 grids - Table, Pie and BarChart.

Can delete, add, and edit the data. (when doing it all the grids are changing accordingly)

Use 
- Laravel as the backend
- React and redux for front
- JQWidgets for the view of the data grids
- Docker file.

.csv file used can be found on the root of this project (test.csv) or [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
